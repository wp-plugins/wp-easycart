== Installation ==

1.  Create 3 new pages in WordPress: An example of the three page names would be 'Store', 'Shopping Cart', and 'My Account'.

2.  Open each page you just created and enter the WordPress shortcode to apply the eCommerce system to those pages. A short code is a word in brackets that is replaced by a plugin or widget when displayed to the user. The image on the right is a screenshot of adding the store shortcode to the store page.

     a.  Open the 'Store' page and type **[ec_store]** in the page text editor.
	 
	 b.  Open 'Shopping Cart' page and type **[ec_cart]** in the page text editor.
	 
     c.  Open 'My Account' page and type **[ec_account]** in the page text editor.

3.  Select the pages you just created in the select boxes below. The will help the WP EasyCart link your store up correctly. That's it! Now you can configure your store or access the admin console area.

4.  Download the administrative console by visiting your administration menu link.  This software lets you manage orders, update products and images, setup customer accounts, promotions, and more.

== Upgrading ==

As with all wordpress plugins, even WordPress themselves suggest to always backup your data.  We recommend you always backup the plugin folder for WP EasyCart.  Usually located under /wp-content/plugins/wp-easycart/ is a good start.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get documentation or demos? =
We offer a full service website with online documentation, video tutorials, community support forums as well as demonstration sites running our various templates at [WP EasyCart](http://www.wpeasycart.com/ "WP EasyCart website") .

= Can I use your software to display, but not sell products? =
Absolutely! If you do not need to sell anything, but would like to leverage our software to display products, please feel free to do just that!

= What is the FREE, Lite, and Standard Versions? =
FREE version comes from wordpress and offers limited features for you test.  Manual payments is accepted, but coupons, live shipping rates, promotions are not included.  Lite version jumps up to 3rd party processing (paypal standard).  The Full version jumps up to coupons, promotions, live shipping, and full payment gateways.

= How does a license work with your software? =
The free plugin is the full software version; however, the administrative software that is downloaded from our website is licensed software. The administrative software will allow a certain number of products and features to be used in the software. You may continue to run the WordPress plugin, but must purchase a license to use our administrative software.
Each license is good for one website URL or WordPress installation. You may transfer a license from a development environment to a production environment at any time; it is your license once you purchase one.
Licensing gives you features such as coupons, promotions, live shipping rate calculators and more. Plus you will receive support from our staff individually rather than through our community open support systems. For more information on licensing, you can view our website.

= Do I have to pay monthly? =
Not to us. Our standard plugin is a one-time purchase. Your payment gateway provider such as PayPal, Authorize.net, FirstData or others may or may not have monthly fees, but nothing through EasyCart.
If you purchase a monthly hosted plan, then we do have a monthly charge program for those who prefer this method.

= Can I display specials on any page? =
Yes you can! Simply go to the widgets page, and drag over the specials widget to any widget area. You can then check a box on the product you want to display in the specials area.

= How do I add a vertical or horizontal store menu to my WordPress site? =
